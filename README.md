# TerraFarm FS25

## Status

\- **Update 15th April**

After months of Giants denying the existence of the terrain collision bug(s), it was finally fixed in patch 1.7. So the work on FS25 version is now progressing again. There is no timeline set, but considering most of the project has been converted it shouldn't take too long.

~~Due to engine bug(s), the process of getting TerraFarm working properly in FS25 is stalled. The main issue is that the terrain collisions are not properly updated when deforming the terrain.~~

~~This has been reported to Giants (not only by me), but there has not been any feedback whether they are working on a fix or if it will ever be fixed.~~

~~So this is out of my hands, and TerraFarm will not be available at all for FS25 unless the terrain collisions issues are resolved.~~
